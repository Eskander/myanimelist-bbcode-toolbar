# Dark Native Media Controls
If you too hate the white controls in the default Google Chrome & Opera HTML5 Video Player then you're in the right place. This script makes the controls bar dark with little transparency like how it should have been.

**It doesn't make sense to install this script in browsers other than chromium-based ones.**

Feel free to [send Feedback][1] or suggest any improvements and also check [my other scripts][2].

[This is an example of a HTML5 Video Player to test the changes yourself.][3]

<h3>Update: May 29, 2018</h3>

As of **Chrome 67**, the design for Native Media Controls has changed. To enable the old style head over to: `chrome://flags/#enable-modern-media-controls` and set **New Media Controls** to **Disabled**
