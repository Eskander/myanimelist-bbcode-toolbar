# Skqnder's userscripts collection
This is a repository where I host all the scripts I publish on [GreasyFork.org](https://greasyfork.org/users/152412#user-script-list).
All contributions and issue reports are welcome.

*Note: I know that hosting several separate projects in one repository is too unprofessional, but a different repository for each script is overkill. Also, I suck at giving names. Suggestions are appreciated.*
